This is stuff you can borrow from me:

Bouncy ball
Toy car
Little shoes that are too small for me
Clothes that are too small for me.
My favourite character is Captain Booberang
Can you see that picture of BB-8? He's my favourite character. He's the first one in the Star Wars. He's from The Force Awakens.
Kids. Can you see that Batman logo? It's sooo cool.

This website is for my dads website building company but he said he saw too many websites and they all looked the same so he said I could make whatever I wanted for his business as long as I said one thing, his email is jamie@verticalgraindesign.com and you can email him there if you want to.
